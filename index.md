## Hey, I’m Jeff.

I’m a dad, a tech nerd, a school bus driver, and a writer trying to help other humans survive this whole “adulting” thing.

This blog is where those worlds collide:

- Parenting when you’re exhausted and broke  
- Tech and real-life problem solving  
- Honest takes on “adulting” without the fake Instagram gloss  

Scroll down for posts.

If you’re here because you’re thinking about hiring me as a writer: hi, hello, yes, I do words.

You’ll mostly see:
- Parenting stories that don’t sugarcoat  
- Practical guides other parents will actually read  
- A conversational tone that sounds like a real person, not a brochure
