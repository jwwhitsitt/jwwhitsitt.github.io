excerpt: >
  If your ideas take too long to explain, that’s usually the problem.
  When people tune out, something isn’t clear.

intro:
  - excerpt: >
      You can have a great idea and still lose people.
      All it takes is a few sloppy lines, a little jargon,
      and one paragraph that drags.
      People don’t stick around to decode it. They bounce.

feature_row_process:
  - title: "Most of my work starts before the writing does."
    excerpt: |
      I ask the questions that sort out what actually matters.  
      I organize the message before polishing the language.  
      I shape it into writing people can follow.

feature_row_fit:
  - title: "This tends to work well for people who:"
    excerpt: |
      - Are good at what they do, but find it hard to explain  
      - Want their audience to actually pay attention  
      - Care more about being understood than sounding impressive  

  - title: "It doesn’t work as well when:"
    excerpt: |
      - Jargon and buzzwords feel necessary  
      - Word count matters more than the message  
      - Sounding smart matters more than being understood
