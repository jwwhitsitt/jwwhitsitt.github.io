Before I had a kid, I had a very confident idea of what kind of parent I was going to be.

I’d make balanced meals. I’d stay calm. I’d limit screen time. My kid would absolutely **not** be the one melting down in public.

You already know where this is going.

## Expectation #1: Calm, Reasonable Conversations

**What I pictured:**  
Me kneeling down at eye level, speaking gently.  
“My dear child, let’s use our words.”

**Reality:**  
I’m in the kitchen at 6:45 a.m., arguing about which color plate is “evil” while the eggs are burning in the frying pan.

Sometimes I’m calm.  
Sometimes it’s, “Fine — use the blue plate. We’re leaving.”

## Expectation #2: Healthy, Instagram-Worthy Meals

**What I pictured:**  
Fresh veggies. Balanced breakfasts. Pinterest-level plating.

**Reality:**  
Sometimes it’s legit breakfast.  
Other days I’m like, “Leftover pizza has protein and calories, let’s go.”

I know what perfect nutrition looks like.  
Time, money, and sanity don’t always cooperate.

## Expectation #3: Limited Screen Time

**What I pictured:** Strict rules. Educational content only.  

**Reality:** Screens buy me 30 minutes to cook, clean, or remember I exist.

Screens aren’t evil.  
They’re a tool — and tools depend on how you use them.

---

## Expectation #4: Consistent Routines

**What I pictured:**  
Perfect bedtime routines, smooth mornings.

**Reality:**  
We have routines… loosely.  
Bedtime happens (mostly).  
Some mornings are smooth; others require a spray bottle with a tight stream.

Consistency matters. Perfection doesn’t.

---

## Expectation #5: Infinite Patience

**What I pictured:** Zen Parent™.  

**Reality:** I’m human. I get stressed. I snap. But now I apologize.

“I shouldn’t have yelled. I’m sorry.”

That’s more important than pretending I never lose it.

## The Point

If you feel like you’re failing the fantasy version of parenting in your head, you’re not alone.

Real parenting is messy, loud, unfiltered chaos.

The goal isn’t perfect.  
The goal is showing up, caring, and trying — even when dinner is frozen something and bedtime is 45 minutes late.

If you want glossy parenting advice, there are plenty of blogs for that.

If you want honest “I’m in the trenches too” content?  
You’re in the right place.
