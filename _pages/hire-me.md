Clear writing for businesses that deal with complex ideas.

I help small businesses explain what they do in plain English, especially when technology is involved.

If your service is solid but your messaging feels confusing, I help fix that.

## What I do

- Website copy that explains your product or service clearly  
- Articles and blog posts that educate without talking down  
- Technical or process-heavy content written for non-technical readers  

## Who this is for

You’ll get the most value working with me if:
- Your business involves technology, systems, or processes  
- You want clarity without hype or buzzwords  
- You care about accuracy and trust  

## Let’s talk
