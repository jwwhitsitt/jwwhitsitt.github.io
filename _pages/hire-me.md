Need a writer who can make complicated stuff feel simple — without talking down to your readers?

Here’s what I’m good at:

- **Blog posts and articles** about parenting, tech, and real-life problem solving  
- **Explainers and how-tos** that people will actually finish reading  
- **Email newsletters** that feel like a conversation, not a sales script  

### What you get working with me

- Clear, conversational writing that still respects accuracy  
- On-time delivery (school bus drivers run on schedules)  
- A collaborator who asks smart questions instead of guessing  

If you’d like to talk about a project, the easiest way to reach me right now is by email:

**➡ `your-email@example.com`**  

(We can swap this out for a real contact method later.)
