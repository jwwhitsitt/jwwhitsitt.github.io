Need to explain what you do without confusing or boring people?

That’s where I come in.

I help small businesses turn complicated ideas into clear, readable content that makes sense to real humans. Especially when technology is involved.

If your product or service is solid but your messaging feels fuzzy, I help clean that up.

## What I help with

I work best on projects where clarity matters more than hype, including:

- Website copy that explains what you do and why it matters  
- Blog posts and articles that educate without talking down  
- Technical or process-heavy content written in plain English  
- Email content that sounds human, not automated  

You don’t need perfect direction. You just need to know what you’re trying to communicate.

We’ll figure out the rest together.

## How I work

I keep things straightforward:

- I ask good questions up front  
- I write clearly and revise thoughtfully  
- I deliver on time  

No buzzwords. No filler. No pretending to be something you’re not.

## Is this a fit?

We’ll probably work well together if:

- Your business involves technology, systems, or processes  
- You care about accuracy but want content people will actually read  
- You want a collaborator, not just a word processor  

If that sounds right, let’s talk.
