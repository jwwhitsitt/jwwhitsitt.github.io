## About

I am a writer who specializes in explaining things clearly, especially when they start out complex, technical, or confusing. I write for people who want substance without jargon and clarity without being talked down to.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of writing and systems. Technology, tools, workflows, and real world problems that make sense once someone takes the time to explain them properly. That is the part I enjoy most.

### How I work

I learn by building things and fixing them when they break. This site is not an accident. I built it, deployed it, and configured the supporting pieces myself, from DNS and domain routing to email setup and deliverability. I do this because understanding how systems actually work makes me a better writer about those systems.

When something is confusing, I dig until I understand it. When something breaks, I trace it until I know why. Then I write about it in a way that saves someone else time and frustration.

That approach shows up in my writing. I ask good questions, focus on clarity first, and think about how information is experienced by the person reading it.

### Technical background, explained plainly

I run a small home lab where I experiment, learn, and occasionally break things on purpose. It includes virtual machines managed with Proxmox, shared storage through a TrueNAS virtual machine, and services like a Plex server for legitimately owned media and private family videos. I also run a Minecraft server and monitor uptime and reliability across the environment.

None of that is about showing off. It is about understanding how systems behave in the real world and why good documentation and clear explanations matter.

Those experiences shape how I write. I understand how small configuration choices ripple outward. I understand why users get frustrated. I understand why clarity is not optional.

### Real world perspective

Outside of writing and technology, I am a parent and a school bus driver. Both roles demand attention, responsibility, and clear communication. Mistakes have consequences. Ambiguity causes problems. That perspective informs how I think about clarity and accountability in my work.

### What I am available for

I work with clients who need clear, conversational writing about technology, systems, tools, and real world problems. Articles, guides, explainers, and website copy where accuracy and readability both matter.

If you need someone who can understand complex material and explain it so it actually gets read, you are in the right place.
