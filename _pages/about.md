I help small businesses explain what they do clearly, especially when technology is involved.

That sounds simple. In practice, it rarely is.

A lot of good businesses struggle to communicate because their work is complex, their systems are messy, or their ideas live in their heads instead of on the page. Customers get confused. Internal documentation never quite gets finished. Websites say a lot, but somehow still miss the point.

That’s the space I work in.

### How I got here

I’m a recent IT graduate with an associate’s degree, but I didn’t come to technology through a straight-line career path. I got here by building things, breaking them, fixing them, and spending a lot of time figuring out how systems actually behave in the real world.

I run a small homelab environment that includes virtualization, storage, and self-hosted services. I’ve configured DNS, email, monitoring, and basic security for my own projects. I tend to dig into how things work, partly out of necessity and partly because I’m curious.

That combination matters.

Plenty of people understand technology. Fewer can explain it without jargon, hype, or talking down to their audience. Writing lives right at the intersection of those two skills.

### How I think about writing

Good writing isn’t about sounding smart. It’s about reducing friction.

My goal is usually pretty straightforward:
- Help the reader feel oriented instead of overwhelmed  
- Explain what matters without burying the point  
- Respect the reader’s intelligence without assuming prior knowledge  

If someone finishes reading and thinks, “That finally makes sense,” the job’s done.

I take a practical approach to content. No buzzwords. No filler. No pretending every paragraph needs to perform. When humor shows up, it’s because it helps the idea land, not because it’s trying to be clever.

### What I focus on

Most of my work falls into two buckets:
- Blog content that builds trust over time  
- Website copy that explains what a business actually does  

This often involves technical topics, systems, or processes that are easy to misunderstand and hard to explain. I’m especially comfortable writing for non-technical audiences who still need accurate, usable information.

### Outside the work

I value clarity, structure, and calm problem-solving. I like systems that make sense and writing that respects the reader’s time. I’m drawn to people who prefer thoughtful solutions over loud ones.

If that sounds like how you approach your business, we’ll probably work well together.
