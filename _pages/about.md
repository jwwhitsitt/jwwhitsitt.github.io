I’m Jeff Whitsitt — a dad, tech nerd, school bus driver, and writer.

I spend my days moving people and my nights moving words around until they make sense. Most of what I write lives at the intersection of:

- **Parenting** when you’re exhausted and broke  
- **Tech and real-life problem solving**  
- **Honest takes on “adulting”** without the fake Instagram gloss  

If you need content that sounds like a real human wrote it — and still respects the facts — that’s my lane.
