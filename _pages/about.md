I help people say the thing they’re trying to say without it turning into a mess.

Most projects don’t fail because the idea is bad. They fail because the explanation never quite lands.

That’s where I tend to come in.

I don’t assume prior knowledge.  
I build understanding step by step.

Before I write anything, I ask questions. I look for what actually matters and what can be left out. I organize the thinking first, then shape the language so it’s clear, readable, and grounded.

### What it’s like to work with me

- Conversations before copy  
- Honest feedback when something isn’t working  
- Writing that sounds like you, not me  

Clear direction helps, but it isn’t required. If things are fuzzy, we’ll sort them out together.

<div style="text-align:center; margin-top:3rem;">
  <a href="/hire-me/"
     style="
       display:inline-block;
       background:#000;
       color:#2ec4c6;
       padding:0.9rem 1.8rem;
       font-size:1.05rem;
       font-weight:600;
       border-radius:6px;
       text-decoration:none;
       transition:background 0.2s ease, color 0.2s ease;
     "
     onmouseover="this.style.background='#111'"
     onmouseout="this.style.background='#000'">
     Let’s talk
  </a>
</div>
